# Three_JS_Project

“Knowing a little about something sometimes gets in the way of knowing a lot about it.”
― Mokokoma Mokhonoana

I did not know about Three Js, but I applied for a internship then they give me a work on three js then, I visited https://threejs.org/ and I liked it and 
as they mentioned that I can make anything in threejs, So I decided to create a model, which perform some action. 

For this, I found the binary file format representation 3d model on the internet for free of cost and download it then I applied this features in model:- 
camera position, 
model animation, 
model colour, 
shadow, 
hemispherical light, 
directional lighting, 
and have also applied sound which creates some uniqueness to project.
